How should I argue that when I trained a cross entropy model I used batch sizes ranging from 256 to 16, but when I trained a siamese network using triplet loss I only used batch sizes 256 and 128, and that the performance was worse (1-shot recognition score) if I used smaller ones?

When discussing the choice of batch sizes in training machine learning models, especially in the context of deep learning where the loss function and architecture can significantly influence the dynamics of training, several key points can be made. In your case, where you trained a model with cross-entropy loss and then a Siamese network using triplet loss, and observed differences in performance with varying batch sizes, here are the points you could argue:

1. Stability of Gradient Estimates
Cross-Entropy Model: Larger batch sizes generally provide more stable and reliable estimates of the gradient, which can help in achieving a more stable convergence, especially in models trained with cross-entropy loss which typically deal with one straightforward task or target.
Siamese Network with Triplet Loss: Triplet loss involves learning from relative comparisons (i.e., an anchor, a positive, and a negative sample). The stability of gradient estimates becomes even more critical as each gradient update is influenced by the relationship between triplets in a batch. Smaller batch sizes might not adequately represent the diversity of relationships needed for effective learning, leading to poorer performance due to less reliable gradient directions.
2. Diversity of Samples in a Batch
Triplet Loss: In triplet-based learning, having a more extensive set of examples in each batch allows the model to see a broader range of positive and negative comparisons. This variety is crucial for the model to generalize well over different data points. Larger batches provide a richer set of triplets, potentially increasing the chance that the sampled triplets are challenging enough to guide effective learning.
Reduced Batch Size Impact: Using smaller batches in a Siamese network with triplet loss might limit the diversity of the triplets, which can impair the learning process. The network might not encounter a sufficient range of scenarios to learn robust embeddings effectively.
3. Learning Rate and Convergence
Interaction with Batch Size: The learning rate and the batch size are interdependent. Larger batch sizes can often sustain higher learning rates because the gradient estimates are less noisy, leading to faster convergence in some cases. With smaller batch sizes, the learning rate often needs to be adjusted downward to prevent divergence or oscillation.
Siamese Networks: If the batch size is reduced without carefully adjusting other training parameters like the learning rate, it could lead to issues with training dynamics, such as slow convergence or getting stuck in suboptimal minima.
4. Computational Efficiency
Resource Utilization: Larger batch sizes generally make better use of GPU hardware due to more efficient matrix operations. In practical terms, this means training can be faster on a per-epoch basis, although the total number of epochs needed for convergence could vary.
Epoch vs. Iteration Trade-off: Training with larger batches might require fewer iterations to pass through the entire dataset (fewer updates), but each iteration is more computationally expensive and uses more memory.
5. Empirical Observations
Model Performance: Your empirical observations indicated that performance (1-shot recognition score) was worse with smaller batch sizes. This can be attributed to the reasons discussed above—mainly the reduced stability of the learning process and inadequate sampling of informative triplets.
Benchmark Against Literature: Support your argument with references to similar studies or established practices in the literature that recommend specific batch sizes for triplet loss and Siamese networks, highlighting the importance of larger batches for training stability and generalization.
Conclusion
When presenting these arguments, it's beneficial to provide detailed empirical results that clearly show how performance varies with batch size. Graphs or tables comparing performance metrics across different batch sizes can be very persuasive. Additionally, discussing the theoretical implications of your choices helps justify your experimental design and findings.

Why is this argument not valid for a classic NN, using cross entropy loss:

The argument about the critical importance of batch size for stability in gradient estimates and the diversity of relationships in the batch, which is particularly relevant for Siamese networks with triplet loss, does not apply directly to classic neural networks using cross-entropy loss for several reasons:

1. Nature of the Loss Function
Triplet Loss: Triplet loss in Siamese networks is inherently comparative and relational. It requires a careful balance between anchors, positives, and negatives to learn useful feature representations. The performance of models using triplet loss is directly influenced by the composition of each batch because the loss calculates distances between an anchor and both a positive and a negative example. The dynamics of this loss necessitate a variety of samples to form effective triplets, particularly to ensure that the network does not learn trivial solutions.
Cross-Entropy Loss: In contrast, cross-entropy loss evaluates the performance of a model on individual examples against their categorical labels. Each training example is treated independently in the loss computation. This loss function measures the dissimilarity between the predicted probability distribution and the true distribution (the label), and each sample's contribution to the gradient update is independent of others.
2. Dependency on Sample Relationships
Triplet Loss: Effective training with triplet loss depends significantly on having a rich set of interactions within each batch to explore a useful space of embeddings. The relationships between different examples (anchor, positive, negative) in the batch are crucial, as these relationships define the learning signal. If a batch lacks diversity, certain important relationships might not be represented, which can impair the network’s ability to learn discriminative features.
Cross-Entropy Loss: For a standard neural network using cross-entropy, the focus is on aligning the network’s outputs with the true labels. While batch diversity can help generalization by providing a broader view of the data distribution per update, it does not fundamentally affect the computation of the loss as each example is evaluated independently.
3. Gradient Stability and Batch Size
Triplet Loss: The argument that smaller batch sizes might lead to poorer performance due to less reliable gradient directions is particularly relevant in triplet-based learning because the variance in the quality and difficulty of the selected triplets can drastically affect learning. Poor triplet selection can lead to noisy or uninformative gradients.
Cross-Entropy Loss: In classical neural networks, while smaller batch sizes do result in noisier gradient estimates, this effect is less about the relational structure within the data and more about the variance in individual data points' features and labels. Thus, while smaller batches can affect convergence speed and path, they do not inherently result in poorer performance if the learning rate and other hyperparameters are appropriately adjusted.
Conclusion
In summary, the unique requirements of triplet loss due to its comparative nature make the batch size and composition arguments more critical than in classical neural networks using cross-entropy loss, where each sample is processed more independently. This difference highlights the importance of understanding the underlying mechanics of loss functions and their interaction with model architecture and training dynamics.
